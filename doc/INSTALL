Installing ngSuggest


Requirements:
- ezfind extension
- ezjscore extension (for jquery)
- ezwebin/ezflow extension


Installing:
1. Extract the ngsuggest extension, and place it in the extensions folder.

2. Enable the extension in eZ Publish. Do this by opening settings/override/site.ini.append.php
   and add in the [ExtensionSettings] block (before ezwebin):
   ActiveExtensions[]=ngsuggest

3. Preparing 'ngsuggest_text' solr field for faceting (not obligatory):
    - Merge content of share/schema.xml into extension/ezfind/java/solr/conf/schema.xml (DO NOT OVERWRITE IT!)
    - Restart your solr servlet (jetty, tomcat,...) if needed
    - Reindex solr data

4. Adding jQuery support.

    a) If jQuery is already used extension/ngsuggest/design/ezwebin/templates/page_head_script.tpl can be deleted

    b) If not, but ezwebin template page_head_script.tpl is used, this step can be skipped (page_head_script.tpl included in extension loads jQuery over ezjscore)

    c) Or download jQuery and load it directly through JavaScriptSettings in design.ini

5. Preparing templates and defining $search_id (id of the search text field)

    a) If default ezwebin search form is used (page_header_searchbox.tpl) this step can be skipped (it is overridden by ngsuggest version). In this case $search_id is: searchtext

    b) If that form is not used it can be included. In this case $search_id is also: searchtext

    c) If more search forms are needed they can be included like this:
    {include uri='design:ngsuggest/searchform.tpl' form_id="[id_of_the_search_form]" search_id="[id_of_the_search_field]"}
    ($form_id and $search_id should be unique HTML ids)

    d) If there is already a search form, search field can be included like this:
    {include uri='design:ngsuggest/searchfield.tpl' form_id="[id_of_the_search_form]" search_id="[id_of_the_search_field]" size="[input_size]" search_name="[name_of_the_search_field]" search_style="[extra_css_style_classes]"}

6. Configure settings/ngsuggest.ini depending on the needs. For every search field ini group can be defined. $search_id is used for the name of the group. There is a [default] group with default settings.
    Following settings can be configured per group:
        - Limit: maximum number of suggestions
        - RootNode: root node id to limit the search
        - Section: array of section id to limit the search
        - Classes: array of class id to limit the search
        - FacetField: what field will be used for facets (ngsuggest_text or ezf_df_text or other)

7. Clear cache.
